  description: "Andr\xE9s Bonifacio was a leader of the Philippine Revolution and
    the president of the Tagalog Republic, a short-lived government in the Philippines.
    Through his work, Bonifacio helped the Philippines break free from Spanish colonial
    rule. His story is still remembered in the Philippines today.\r\nKatipunan, or
    Kataastaasang Kagalannalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (literally \"Highest
    and Most Respected Society of the Children of the Country\"), was dedicated to
    armed resistance against the colonial government. Made up mostly of people from
    the middle and lower classes, the Katipunan organization soon established regional
    branches in a number of provinces across the Philippines."
