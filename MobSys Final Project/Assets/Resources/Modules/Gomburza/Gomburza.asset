  description: "Gomburza refers to a group of Filipino priests who were prominent
    figures in Philippine history during the 19th century. The term \"Gomburza\"
    is an acronym derived from the surnames of the three priests: Mariano G\xF3mez,
    Jos\xE9 Apolonio Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora. They were implicated in the Cavite
    Mutiny of 1872, which was an uprising among Filipino soldiers and workers against
    Spanish colonial rule. Despite their actual involvement being unclear, they were
    swiftly accused and subsequently executed through garrote on February 17, 1872,
    in Bagumbayan, Manila. Their execution sparked outrage among Filipinos and fueled
    the flames of the nationalist movement against Spanish oppression. Gomburza's
    martyrdom became a symbol of resistance and inspired many Filipino revolutionaries
    in their fight for independence from Spain. Their legacy continues to be remembered
    and celebrated in Philippine history and culture as champions of freedom and
    justice."
