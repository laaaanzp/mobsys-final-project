  description: Intramuros, meaning "within the walls" in Spanish, is a historic walled
    city located in Manila, Philippines. Built during the Spanish colonial period,
    it served as the seat of government, religious, and military power in the country.
    The walls of Intramuros were constructed to protect the city from foreign invasions
    and pirate attacks. Today, Intramuros is a popular tourist destination, offering
    visitors a glimpse into the Philippines' colonial past through its well-preserved
    Spanish-era architecture, cobblestone streets, and historic landmarks such as
    Fort Santiago and San Agustin Church. Visitors can explore the area on foot,
    take guided tours, or enjoy horse-drawn carriage rides along its charming streets.
