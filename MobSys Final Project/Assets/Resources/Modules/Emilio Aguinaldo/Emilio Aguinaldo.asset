  description: "Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy was a prominent Filipino revolutionary leader,
    politician, and military general who played a key role in the Philippine struggle
    for independence from Spanish and American colonial rule. Born in Cavite El Viejo
    (now Kawit), Cavite, Aguinaldo was the seventh of eight children in a wealthy
    and influential family.\r\nAguinaldo's political career began early when he was
    elected as the mayor of Cavite El Viejo in 1895. His leadership and organizational
    skills soon brought him to the forefront of the revolutionary movement against
    Spanish rule. In 1896, when the Philippine Revolution broke out, Aguinaldo joined
    the Katipunan, an underground society led by Andr\xE9s Bonifacio dedicated to
    achieving Philippine independence through armed struggle.\r\nAguinaldo declared
    Philippine independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite, after
    forming a new revolutionary government. However, the Spanish-American War altered
    the course of the revolution. Following Spain's defeat, the Treaty of Paris (1898)
    transferred control of the Philippines to the United States, leading to the Philippine-American
    War.\r\nAguinaldo led the Filipino forces against American troops but was eventually
    captured on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela. His capture marked the decline
    of organized resistance against American rule. After his release from captivity,
    Aguinaldo retired from public life for several years."
