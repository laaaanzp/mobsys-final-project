  description: "Casa Manila, also known as the \"Manila House,\" is a living museum
    that provides a vivid portrayal of an affluent Filipino family's lifestyle during
    the late Spanish colonial period. Modeled after a residence from 1850s Binondo,
    the Chinese district of Manila, its fa\xE7ade exudes historical charm. Inside,
    visitors are transported to the late 19th century, where European and Chinese
    furniture adorn the rooms. Painted walls, crystal chandeliers, and intricate
    carvings showcase the opulence of Manila's elite households from centuries past.
    Casa Manila offers a captivating journey through time, allowing visitors to experience
    the elegance and luxury of a bygone era."
